            <h2 class="m3-headline-medium">An Unexpected Find</h2>
            <p>
                On January 17, while browsing the Facebook Marketplace, I came across an iMac priced at $50, thinking it was a great deal. However, the seller hadn't posted a picture of the device turned on, so I asked him about it. Upon receiving confirmation, I promptly made the purchase and opted for shipping, paying an additional $22.
            </p>
            <p>
                Two days later, the seller stopped responding. Just as I thought it might be a scam, he messaged me, stating that he would personally drive to my dorm to deliver the iMac. He explained that he lacked confidence in shipping, prompting him to drive 25 miles. I was grateful for his kindness and appreciative of his generosity. What a nice person.
            </p>

            <h2 class="m3-headline-medium">First Impressions & Diagnosis</h2>
            <p>
                The iMac, a significant and heavy item, exceeded my expectations. The desk was a bit of a mess, and it was larger than I thought. The only thing I knew was that it had a 15-inch display, so I didn’t think it would take up too much space, but it actually took up 50% of the desk. Despite the clutter, I was delighted to finally meet the iMac in person. After I connected the power cord, it booted immediately with a charm!
            </p>
            <p>
                What I got here was the base model of the first version of the iMac G4, with a 700 MHz PowerPC G4 processor, a 40 GB hard drive, and 256 MB of RAM. It was running Mac OS X 10.4.9, last updated in 2007. The machine boasted more than 10 ports, including mini VGA, USB 1.1, FireWire 400, and even a modem port—a true relic of its time.
            </p>

            <h2 class="m3-headline-medium">The Repair Begins</h2>
            <p>
                Opening this thing took me a second. The motherboard looked a bit dusty, but for a 21-year-old iMac, it was in great shape. The reason I opened it was because the power button was broken in half, giving me a reason to fix it. I tried to bend it back a bit, but it just came off. My lack of soldering skills made me struggle at that time.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also took the little PRAM battery "bomb" out of the motherboard. I had heard many people say that the battery could leak electrolyte, causing corrosion and potentially damaging the entire board. Fortunately, I was lucky this time, and nothing happened. This little thing is the only item I kept after selling the iMac.
            </p>

            <h2 class="m3-headline-medium">The Road to Restoration</h2>
            <p>
                Since the power button was soldered to the motherboard, its detachment left me without any tools for a proper repair. I was stuck for several days. After seeking help on an online forum to no avail, I decided to take a more direct approach. I discovered that a complete replacement motherboard with a working power button was available on eBay for about $70. Seeing this as the most practical solution, I purchased it.
            </p>
            <p>
                On January 27th, the replacement motherboard arrived. The task was essentially a "heart transplant" for the iMac. After carefully swapping the boards and putting everything back together, I pressed the (new) power button. It worked like nothing even happened! I was so stoked to see the machine come back to life.
            </p>

            <h2 class="m3-headline-medium">The Perfect Setup (Almost)</h2>
            <p>
                Oh, I forgot to mention one thing - it didn’t come with all the accessories I wanted. But no worries, I managed to shell out $30 and get the perfect additions. I went for the M8541 keyboard, paired with a sleek white Pro Mouse. Now, it was absolutely perfect! To make this iMac even more perfect, I purchased the original discs set and even made a copy for the Classic Mac OS 9.2 environment.
            </p>
            
            <img src="./assets/iMac G4s/imacg4thumbnail.jpeg" alt="The iMac G4 with its matching Pro Mouse and Keyboard" class="article-image">

            <p>
                When I felt everything had become perfect, reality struck me head-on. After attempting to load those CDs, the drive abruptly stopped working. It couldn't read all discs and kept displaying annoying warnings. Then, the major issue I faced was with the neck; the rubber came off and couldn't be reattached. Fixing it would require more soldering work. It was really disheartening.
            </p>

            <h2 class="m3-headline-medium">Epilogue</h2>
            <p>
                So, even though the CD drive was only partially functional, I was able to make the system work with all the original apps. It even came with some amazing early 3D promo games for Mac, which were pretty fun. But it was such a struggle finding all those things for the iMac. I was putting in so much effort to make it all good, but things just kept changing.
            </p>
            <p>
                After two months, I finally came across a super nice person who was willing to take all those things off my hands. I had spent so much time and energy on it, hoping it would find a better home. This whole experience taught me one thing though - without professionals, all I was doing was inadvertently destroying the computers.
